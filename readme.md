----------------WEATHER-APP-PROJECT--------------------
--------------BY-HARSHVARDHAN-RATHORE------------------

i had made this weather ap using openweather api i have shown all the data using html and tailwind css 



issues faced during the project:-
.it was difficult to identifie how to get the info form api to the html how convert it to requird form because no project as simlar as this was done in the class

. had problem after installing tailwind  pushing the it to git  -- but it was solved with the help of rittik sir

.had problem in desiging the project using the tailwind css 

.had problem in the dropdown i was not getting how to make it  -- but with the help of rittik sir i made it 



suggestion:-

. There should be a class in which a good js project is made from scratch so we can indept know how to know which data requird how to get it where it needed. there is one project class but its if we had another one it would be great 

. there should be a tailwind css project  class that will also help
